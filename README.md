# chibicc: A Small C Compiler from Rui Ueyama

This project has been forked from https://github.com/rui314/chibicc

I want to play with it and to add some other options like choosing other linker than default ld.
It's for learning purposes too, to try to understand existing code and to extend it.
Using PVS.studio to find some potential issues and fix them.

Trying to work on issues and pull requests done in the original repository.

## usage

./chibicc --help
or
./chibicc -h

    chibicc is a C compiler based on chibicc created by Rui Ueyama.
    See original project https://github.com/rui314/chibicc for more information
    this chibicc contains only some differences for now like new parameters
    chibicc usage :
    --help or -h print the help
    --version or -v print the version of chibicc
    -cc1 run the cc1 function needs -cc1-input (-cc1-output optional) parameter
    -fuse-ld to specify other linker than ld used by default
    -x Specify the language of the following input files.
        Permissible languages include: c assembler none
        'none' means revert to the default behavior of
        guessing the language based on the file's extension.
    -S generate assembly file
    -o path to output executable if omitted a.out generated
    -c path to source to compile
    -Xlinker <arg> Pass <arg> on to the linker.
    -Wl,<options> Pass comma-separated <options> on to the linker.
    -z <arg> Pass <arg> on to the linker.
    -soname <arg> Pass -soname <arg> on to the linker.
    --version-script <arg> Pass --version-script <arg> to the linker.
    -I<path> Pass path to the include directories
    -L<path> Pass path to the lib directories
    -D<macro> define macro example -DM13
    -U<macro> undefine macro example -UM13
    -s to strip all symbols during linkage phasis
    -M -MD -MP -MMD -MF <arg> -MT <arg> -MQ <arg> compiler write a list of input files to
        stdout in a format that "make" command can read. This feature is
        used to automate file dependency management
    -fpic or -fPIC Generate position-independent code (PIC)
    -fno-pic disables the generation of position-independent code with relative address references
    -fcommon is the default if not specified, it's mainly useful to enable legacy code to link without errors
    -fno-common specifies that the compiler places uninitialized global variables in the BSS section of the object file.
    -static  pass to the linker to link a program statically
    -pthread pass to the linker to link with lpthread library
    -shared pass to the linker to produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to form an executable.
    -hashmap-test to test the hashmap function
    -idirafter <dir> apply to lookup for both the #include "file" and #include <file> directives.
    -### to dump all commands executed by chibicc
    -debug to dump all commands executed by chibicc in a log file in /tmp/chibicc.log
    -E Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.
        The output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the standard output.
        Input files that donâ€™t require preprocessing are ignored.
    -rpath <dir> Add a directory to the runtime library search path this parameter is passed to the linker.
        This is used when linking an ELF executable with shared objects.
        All -rpath arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker,
        which uses them to locate shared objects at runtime.
        The -rpath option is also used when locating shared objects
        which are needed by shared objects explicitly included in the link.
    -dumpmachine it's required by some projects returns x86_64-linux-gnu
    -dotfile generates a file with .dot extension that can be visualized using graphviz package
    chibicc [ -o <path> ] <file>

## Examples

Note that probably you need to define the include parameter and lib parameter to be able to execute these examples outside the chibicc directory. If you forgot you will have similar error message :

    /usr/include/stdio.h:33: #include <stddef.h>
                                    ^ stddef.h: cannot open file: No such file or directory

To solve it, add the include and lib parameter like below assuming that we are in the parent chibicc directory :

        chibicc pointerofpointers.c -I./chibicc/include -L./chibicc/lib

printing the help

    ./chibicc --help

    ./chibicc -h

printing the version

    ./chibicc --version

    ./chibicc -v

compiling and generating an executable

    ./chibicc -o ./test/hello ./test/hello.c

specifying another linker than the default one here lld :

    ./chibicc -o ./test/hello ./test/hello.c -fuse-ld ld.lld

specifying another linker than the default one here mold (https://github.com/rui314/mold)

    ./chibicc -o ./test/hello ./test/hello.c -fuse-ld mold

generating assembly file

    ./chibicc -S ./test/hello.c

generating a.out file if no parameter -o provided

    ./chibicc ./test/hello.c

generating the object only : it generates the pointerofpointers.o

    ./chibicc -c pointerofpointers.c -I./chibicc/include -L./chibicc/lib

generating executable from objects :

    ./chibicc pointerofpointers.o -o pointersofpointers

defining condition at compile time :

    ./chibicc -o ./test/mydefine ./test/define.c -DM13 -I../include -L../lib
    ./test/mydefine
    3

undefining condition at compile time :

    ./chibicc -o ./test/mydefine ./test/define.c -UM13 -I../include -L../lib
    ./test/mydefine
    4

By default the symbol tables is populated:

    chibicc -o ./test/mydefine ./test/define.c
    objdump -t ./test/mydefine
    ./test/mydefine:     file format elf64-x86-64
    SYMBOL TABLE:
    0000000000000000 l    df *ABS*  0000000000000000              crt1.o
    0000000000400320 l     O .note.ABI-tag  0000000000000020              \_\_abi_tag
    0000000000000000 l    df *ABS*  0000000000000000              crtstuff.c

Stripping symbol tables during linkage phasis adding -s parameter :

    ./chibicc -o ./test/mydefine ./test/define.c -s
    objdump -t ./test/mydefine
    ./test/mydefine:     file format elf64-x86-64
    SYMBOL TABLE:
    no symbols

other way to generate assembly file

    ./chibicc ./test/define.c -cc1 -cc1-input ./test/define.c -cc1-output mydefine.s

generating dependencies in std output :

    ./chibicc  ./test/define.c -M
    define.o: \
    ./test/define.c \
    /usr/include/stdio.h \
    /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/libc-header-start.h \
    /usr/include/features.h \

generating dependencies in a output file with ".d" extension and generating executable a.out :

    ./chibicc  ./test/define.c -MD
    ls *.d
    define.d

## options always passed to the linker

it means that if you don't use the ld linker or ld.lld probably some options should be conditionned depending your linker

## Dockerfile and devcontainer

Adding dockerfile suggested by 0xc0 https://github.com/0xc0/chibicc/tree/new
To build :

    docker build -t chibicc .

Adding also a devcontainer for those that want to use visual code inside a container (needs vs code extension remote-containers).

## Examples of C projects compiled successfully using chibicc

for some projects you need to define CC=chibicc before executing ./configure.

curl : https://github.com/curl/curl.git

    autoreconf -fi
    CC=chibicc CFLAGS=-fpic LDFLAGS=-fpic ./configure --with-openssl
    make

        CCLD     curl

openssl : https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

    CC=chibicc ./Configure
    
    You need to remove from the file from openssl/crypto/perlasm/x86_64-xlate.pl

## Limits

Some C projects doesn't compile for now. It helps to find some bugs and to try to fix them!

VLC : https://github.com/videolan/vlc.git 

    ./bootstrap
    CC=chibicc CFLAGS="-fPIC" DEFS="-DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DHAVE_ATTRIBUTE_PACKED -DVLC_USED -DVLC_API -DVLC_DEPRECATED -DVLC_MALLOC" ./configure --disable-lua --disable-a52 --disable-xcb --disable-qt --disable-po --target=linux
    make all

    VLC doesn't compile with chibicc because it has some extended assembly inline that are not managed yet. Even if for this part I'll try to use gcc it failed during linking with multiple definitions. If I use gcc to compile VLC it compiles fine. Perhaps mixing chibicc and gcc is not a great idea!
    

## TODO

- trying to compile other C projects from source to see what is missing or which bug we have with chibicc.
- trying to manage other assembly functions like \_\_asm\_\_("xchgb %b0,%h0": "=Q"(x):"0"(x));

## issues and pull requests fixed

## debug

To debug with gdb don't forget to use the set follow-fork-mode child because chibicc creates a child job.

    gdb ./chibicc
    (gdb) set follow-fork-mode child
    (gdb) r issues/issue116.c -o issues/issue116
    Starting program: /home/stormalf/ubuntu/chibicc/chibicc issues/issue116.c -o issues/issue116
