# chibicc: A Small C Compiler from Rui Ueyama

This project has forked from https://github.com/rui314/chibicc

I want to play with it and to add some other options like choosing other linker than default ld.
It's for learning purposes too, to try to understand existing code and to extend it.
Using PVS.studio to find some potential issues and fix them.

## usage

./chibicc --help

chibicc [ -o <path> ] <file>
